# ATM-Transaction-Analysis-Dashboard

#### Introduction:
In the rapidly evolving financial landscape, Automated Teller Machines (ATMs) play a crucial role in providing accessible banking services to customers. Efficient management and analysis of ATM operations are vital for financial institutions to maintain high levels of service, optimize costs, and enhance profitability. The ATM Transaction Analysis Dashboard is designed to offer a detailed overview of ATM performance, including cost analysis, revenue generation, and transaction trends. By leveraging advanced data analytics and visualization techniques using Power BI, this dashboard provides stakeholders with actionable insights to drive strategic decision-making and operational efficiency.

#### Objective:
The primary objective of the ATM Transaction Analysis Dashboard is to equip stakeholders with comprehensive and actionable insights into ATM operations, facilitating informed decision-making and strategic planning. The specific objectives include:

1. **Cost Analysis**:
   - To break down ATM maintenance costs into specific categories such as Cash Replenishment Agency (CRA), ATM Annual Maintenance Contract (AMC), Site Maintenance, Spare Replacement, Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) AMC, and Very Small Aperture Terminal (VSAT) AMC.
   - To identify areas where cost-saving measures can be implemented, thereby enhancing operational efficiency and reducing unnecessary expenditures.

2. **Revenue Analysis**:
   - To highlight revenue generated from ATMs, the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), and overall monthly revenue across various regions.
   - To provide insights into regional revenue contributions, helping in strategizing regional focus and improving profitability.

3. **Transaction Trends**:
   - To compare financial and non-financial transactions across different months, identifying patterns and trends that can aid in predicting future transaction volumes.
   - To ensure that ATMs are well-maintained and capable of handling peak transaction periods through predictive maintenance.

4. **Performance Metrics**:
   - To monitor key performance metrics such as total cost, average total transactions, gross profit percentage, average uptime, and average EBILL.
   - To provide a quick snapshot of the overall efficiency and profitability of ATM operations.

5. **Detailed Analysis**:
   - To offer a detailed breakdown of revenue performance by state, categorized by rent, monthly revenue, gross profit percentage, average uptime, average total transactions, and EBILL.
   - To assess the financial health and operational efficiency of ATMs at a granular level, guiding decisions to improve profitability and service quality.

By achieving these objectives, the ATM Transaction Analysis Dashboard aims to support financial institutions in optimizing their ATM network, enhancing customer satisfaction, and improving overall financial performance.
